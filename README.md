# API Countries

## Description
API Countries provides data such as capital, population, currency, and continent of a country. This API is built upon the REST Countries API, which is accessible at [https://restcountries.com/](https://restcountries.com/). It serves as a convenient wrapper, allowing easy access to country-related information through a standardized API interface.

1. Clone the project: `git clone ...`
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

The API will be running and accessible at port 3000.

## Usage
